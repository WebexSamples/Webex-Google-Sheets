# WebexTeamsBotToGoogle

This quick walkthrough is intended to give you a very simple Webex Teams bot – it sends content from a Webex Teams space to a Google spreadsheet. Nothing too fancy, but easy to build on. The commands will be passed to the bot using mentions – so if the following command is typed into a room where the bot is a participant:

## @botname hello

The bot will retrieve that command, process it, post the message to a blank Google spreadsheet.
